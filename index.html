            <h3>Bleach</h3>
            <p>is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name.
                 It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV Tokyo from 
                 October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki 
                 after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from 
                 another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending
                  humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga 
                  series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines and characters
                   not found in the manga.</p>
